About me:
Born in Australia with a Chinese-Vietnamese background, youngest of two. 
As far as cultural identity, my parents would call me Australian but most Australians would call me Asian, just to paint a picture of the identity struggle many Australian-born minorities such as myself face.
For hobbies I enjoy playing video games, going to the gym, playing guitar, reading and creative writing.

Fun Fact: Have previously competed at a national level at swimming, tennis and most recently video games.</p>
